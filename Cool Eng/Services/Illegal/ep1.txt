Isn't it a bit fucked up
wearing his clothes?

I think the fucked up bit
was murdering him.

Sorry. It's OK.

Should we go to the police?

What?

It was self-defence.

We broke into his house, James.

Yeah, he was going to hurt you.

You think that they're going
to believe that?

It's the truth.

VOICEOVER: Alyssa seemed
weirdly calm.

VOICEOVER: Fuck, fuck.

We need to get rid of the body.

Come on.

James!

Sorry.

One, two, three!

Shit!

Again.

One, two, three.

Dead people are heavier than
alive people.

I read that.

Good to know.

We need to clean everything up.

We need to get rid of any
trace of us.

Do you hear me, James?

Do you understand?

No-one can know that we've
been here, OK?

If we can't get rid of him,
we've got to get rid of us.

Go find some bleach.

Take your shoes off,
and clean up that blood!

VOICEOVER: This is bad!
This is really fucking bad!

VOICEOVER: Alyssa seemed to
know what she was doing.

I figured that if I just
did what I was told,

then it might be all right.

VOICEOVER: I don't know if this is
the right thing to be doing,

I'm just thinking about what
people on the TV do

when they've done this.

VOICEOVER: She said it would help

to have some music on
whilst we cleaned.

It kind of did.

James?

VOICEOVER: It wasn't how I
thought it would be.

Not at all.

James. Yeah?

What are you doing?

James?

I don't know.

VOICEOVER: What the fuck
is he doing?

What have you done?

He was gonna hurt you, Alyssa.

He was.

SOMEONE SCREAMS IN VIDEO

OK. Put those around him,
and then let's get out of here.

VOICEOVER: Keep it together.
Keep it together.

MUSIC: Smile
By Timi Yuro

VOICEOVER: We learnt, much later,
that we'd really messed up.

VOICEOVER: It's strange. A lot of
the time you don't register

the important moments
in your life as they happen.

You only see that they were
important when you look back.

Like, that was an ending.

So was that.

Fuck off.

VOICEOVER: And that was... That was
the beginning of something.

Something massive.

Maybe something massive and awful,
really awful,

like, fuck up your whole life awful.

I need to get to my dad's as
soon as possible,

before anybody finds a body.

OK.

He'll know what to do.

Come on.

# Outside the window they're singing

♪ Inside the doorway there's me. ♪

Why didn't you burn your jacket?

It didn't have any blood on it.

Yes, but... I'm not getting
rid of it, James.

It's my dad's.

James?

James! We should wait for a bit.

What, why?

If we get this one,
we're travelling peak.

It's more expensive.

VOICEOVER: I think there's
something wrong with him.

VOICEOVER: Fuck. Fuck,
we killed someone.

We fucking killed someone.

What if someone saw us?

What if someone saw us
leave the house?!

What if someone recognises us?

Fuck!

We need to change the way we look.

VOICEOVER: Turns out James is
quite a good hairdresser.

My mum always wanted me
to go blonde.

Guess she'll be really fucking
pleased with me.

We need new clothes.

VOICEOVER: I think it's fair to say

that my disguise wasn't as
effective as Alyssa's.

I looked pretty much the same.

Is there not another size?
These are a bit tight.

It was a shit Oxfam,
they had about ten things.

It's not my fault you look
thinner than you are.

VOICEOVER: I don't recognise myself.

Jesus, it's so quiet here.

Where did you get the knife from?

What?

The one you killed him with.

Was it yours?

Hello?

Clive?

Darling?

WOMAN SCREAMS

Jesus.

Hiya.

Hi.

Got you this.

It's a crime scene.

So... So.

Sorry... Please go ahead.

Please. I was just going to say
Clive Koch, late 40s.

Clive what?

Koch? Let me just see.

K-O-C-H, probably German.

He was found by his mother.

Late 70s. God.

Poor thing, she didn't have a clue
what was going on.

Is that a new coat?

No.

Really nice...

..cut.

Fucking hell!

Quite a buff on that.

Found this. Under the bed.

Terry.

Do you want to tell us
why we've got your wallet here?

She said she was 17,
I swear to you, I asked.

I asked like a few times.

She showed me her ID.

It said 17, I swear I checked.

Calm down! I promise you.

OK, now let me see if I've
got this straight.

You met this girl for the first time
yesterday, completely randomly,

and went back to this house
with her?

For sex, right?
No, we never had sex.

The sex, or lack thereof is not
why you're here.

What?

You had no idea whose house it was?

No, what you talking about?

The man whose house it was,
he was murdered last night.

Oh, fuck me, this is all just...

Tell me about the girl.

What was her name?

Alyssa.

Alyssa, what are we going to do?

Are we still going to your dad's?

Well, we should probably eat
something.

Alyssa had started being weird
with me.

It was a present from my dad.

The knife.

What's it for? Hunting.

Yeah, cos that's a big thing
where we live, isn't it?

Who carries a hunting knife around
with them, James?

I realised that she was
scared of me.

That felt kind of unfair.

I'd been her protector.

Did you notice anything
distinctive about her?

Angry looking?

But almost pretty
but actually average.

And do you want to give her a score
out of ten?

Like...

I'm joking.

Oh, no, no, I mean like she's fine,
she's fine, not like

a model, you know?

What was she wearing?

Before you undressed her and tried
to have sex with her, I mean.

Just like normal, I don't know,
jeans, a T-shirt,

and this weird jacket.

Weird like how?

It was, like, quite shit.

Weird because it was quite shit,
but sort of cool because it was,

do you know what I mean?

No.

It was like a brown leather jacket,
sort of baggy on her.

Oh, and it wasn't just her,

in the house, yeah, there was
another guy there too.

This guy? No, no, no,
he was younger.

Erm, ah, I think his name was...

..James?

I decided to put on a calmer,
more relaxed demeanour.

To reassure Alyssa.

There's definitely
something wrong with him.

You OK? What?

Are you OK? Yeah.

It didn't work.

What's the matter?

What's the matter?

What's the matter? The matter,
James, is that last night

you fucking murdered someone.

And every time I try to close my
eyes or think about anything,

anything else, all I can see
is his face.

And his neck, and you stabbing him.

Thanks.

Do you want mustard too?

On chips?

Some people like it.

SHE GIGGLES

Alyssa... I don't want to hold
your hand.

I'm going to the toilet.

Sorry.

So, his alibi checks out.

What?

Clive Koch died between midnight
and 3am,

the twat in there was at
a house party during that time.

Witnesses? Yes.

Lot's of other twats.

OK.

Listen, I've been meaning to, um...

..could we have a quick chat
at some point?

What about?

Well, you know,

I thought could we talk about
what happened the other night?

You know what?

Don't worry about it.

OK, let's put out a request for any
sightings or any crimes involving

two teenagers in the area.

Give them a description of the
jacket

and put the names Alyssa
and James into missing persons.

Either they killed him,
or they might have seen who did.

We need to find them.

My heart can't take this.

MUSIC: Lonesome Town
by Ricky Nelson

I sat for about half an hour until
I realised that Alyssa had left.

# There's a place where lovers go

♪ To cry their troubles away... ♪

That was the day I learned
that silence is really loud.

Deafening.

I think maybe my dad spent his whole
life trying to avoid silence.

When you have silence,
it's hard to keep stuff out.

It's all there,

and you can't get rid of it.

I used to be able to get rid
of things,

banish them.

# Goin' down to lonesome town

# Where the broken hearts stay

♪ Goin' down to lonesome town... ♪

But I knew after that day,
it wouldn't be so easy any more.

♪ In the town of broken dreams... ♪

You all right?

Do you want to hit me?

Are you OK?

Please, will you beat me up?

I'll pay you.

I was never Alyssa's protector.

She was mine.

Having finally murdered a human...

..I realised something
quite important...

Police, please.

I was pretty sure I wasn't
a psychopath.

I'd like to report a murder.
